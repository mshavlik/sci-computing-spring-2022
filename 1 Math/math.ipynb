    "Normal python files (.py) only contain python statements and expressions. Python notebooks (.ipynb) contain *cells* than can have python but also the results of cells (including graphics and interactive components) and structured text (markdown). Having the ability to include formatted notes and graphical output in the same file is very powerful. One minor downside is that the notebook file cannot be directly executed by the python interpreter. Let's run some python! If python is worth its salt, it better be able to take advantage of the computers ability to do math quickly. Let's try some basic operations. When using a notebook remember that\n",
